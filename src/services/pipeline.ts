 * Pipeline orchestrator.

 * Drives one document from a freshly-uploaded ARAG resource to a finished canonical
 * `DocumentRecord`. It runs inside a platform **job** (kind `process-document`), so every
 * stage is emitted as a `JobEvent` and streamed to clients over
 * `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}/events` (SSE) — the SSE stream is a *view* of the job, not the
 * work itself, so a disconnecting client no longer kills (or keeps alive) the run.
 *
 *   process → classify → extract → entities → summary → validate → standardize
 *
 * Each stage is wrapped so a failure degrades gracefully: the run continues with the
 * best record it has rather than dying, and the failure is surfaced as a stage error.

/**
 * Write a finished record's fields into its resource's key-value field, and record on the

 *
 * ### The overwrite trap
 *
 * A kv write is a **full replace** of the schema's data, and — this is the part that has to
 * be designed around rather than papered over — overwriting a value does **not** remove the
 * old one from the Knowledge Box's filter index. The index accumulates every value ever
 * written to that field on that resource, and there is no purge call. A resource whose
 * `vendor` was corrected from "Acme" to "Acme Pty Ltd" keeps matching a filter on "Acme"
 * forever.
 *
 * So the rule is **write once per resource**: the pipeline writes when the record is
 * finished, and nothing writes again unless a human corrects a field or the document is
 * reprocessed. When a second write is unavoidable, it is not hidden — `writes` counts them,
 * `filterIndexStale` goes true, and `superseded` keeps the values the resource still
 * wrongly matches, so the UI can say so in as many words.
 *
 * Never throws: a Knowledge Box that refuses the values is a degraded record, not a failed
 * document. The caller records a `stageErrors` entry from the returned `error`.
